# Annotations

Annotations are information for lexour that are included in the code block
itself. They are essentially meta-comments, and will not be included in the
final rendering.

## Comment Annotations (comment)

With annotations, you can include normal comments in your code block _in
addition to comments about the block itself_. For example, if you're writing a
lesson on coding, you may have intentionally written a section wrong and/or
messy:

<Awaiting />

Now if somebody else is looking at the lesson, they'll know why forEach was used
instead of map!

## Keep Annotations (keep)

## Mark As Annotations (mark-as)

## Next Line (next-line)
