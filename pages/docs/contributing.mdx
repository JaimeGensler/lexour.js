# Contributing

This page includes guidelines for adding issues to lexour's github page as well
as submitting pull requests to lexour. If you're looking to contribute to lexour
(either thru a PR or an issue), thank you! It means the world to me!

<Conduct />

## Creating Issues (issues)

If you run into issues with lexour, make sure you've skimmed the documentation
first! In particular, if your issue relates to token types, please
&#32;<InLink href={lexp}>read the lexer explanation</InLink> to make sure that
your problem isn't explained there. If your problem isn't solved anywhere,
please <ExLink href={newIss}>make an issue on Github</ExLink> and include the
following information:

-   Version of lexour _and React_ you are using.
-   Nature of the issue (tokenization, annotations, accessibility, mobile-use,
    browser support, et cetera).
-   A description of the issue, including steps to recreate it, the expected
    behavior, and other relevent information (browser/device, language).

Issues around accessibility and tokenizing will be resolved as quickly as
possible.

## General Pull Request Guidelines (general)

## Language Pull Requests (language)

If you've built a tokenizer for a language not already included in lexour,
you're welcome to submit a pull request! At present, for a language-support
request to be approved, it must:

-   Follow the <InLink href="#general">general contribution guidelines</InLink>.
-   Be written using <ExLink href={moo}>Moo</ExLink>. _PRs that add new
    dependencies to tokenize code won't be approved_.
-   Be complete, including:

    <NestedUL>
        <LI>support for lexour annotations</LI>
        <LI>
            use of <code>moo.error</code> to catch anything otherwise not
            covered by your rules.
        </LI>
        <LI>
            reuse of token names where sensible (**SEE HERE**), and new token
            names that follow this convention otherwise.
        </LI>
    </NestedUL>

-   Include support for lexour annotations.
-   Be for a language used by others. PRs to add toy languages won't be
    approved, but don't worry - lexour still has built-in &#32;
    <InLink href={lang}>support for your language</InLink>!

You'll likely need to make reasonable assumptions about how the language is
used - read the &#32; <InLink href={lexp}>lexer explanation</InLink> to get an
idea of some of the assumptions that were made for JavaScript/TypeScript.
