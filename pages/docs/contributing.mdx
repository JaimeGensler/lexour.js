# Contributing

This page includes guidelines for adding issues to lexour's github page as well
as submitting pull requests to lexour. If you're looking to contribute to lexour
(either thru a PR or an issue), thank you! It means the world to me!

<Conduct />

## Creating Issues (issues)

## General Pull Request Guidelines (general)

## Language-related Pull Requests (language)

If you've built a tokenizer for a language not already included in lexour,
you're welcome to submit a pull request! At present, for a language-support
request to be approved, it must:

-   Follow the <InLink href="#general">general contribution guidelines</InLink>.
-   Be written using <ExLink href={moo}>Moo</ExLink>. &#32;
    <EM>PRs that add new dependencies to tokenize code won't be approved</EM>.
-   Be complete. You'll likely need to make reasonable assumptions about how the
    language is used - read the &#32;
    <InLink href={lexp}>lexer explanation</InLink> to get an idea of assumptions
    that are made for JavaScript/TypeScript.
-   Include support for lexour annotations.
-   Be for a **\_FIND A WORD FOR THIS\_** language. PRs to add your toy language
    won't be approved, but lexour still has built-in &#32;
    <InLink href={lang}>support for your language</InLink>!
