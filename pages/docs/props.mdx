# Props

lexour's `<CodeBlock />` component accepts a few custom props, as well as many
standard props. This page details how you can use both the props unique to
lexour, as well as built-in props to style your codeblock.

## Custom Props (custom-props)

Hello there

<PropsTable />

The type <TypeName>BuiltInLang</TypeName> currently has possible values of:

-   `"html"`
-   `"css"`

**React code must be passed as JSX or TSX** - using JS or TS for React will
result in incorrectly tokenized code.

---

The type <TypeName>BuiltInTheme</TypeName> currently has possible values of

-   `"oneDarkPro"`
-   `"githubLight"`

Lexour will handle a couple details of rendering for you - line numbers are not
selectable text (on any browser), and are not added to the raw "code" input, so
you can safely select and copy only the code, or add copy-on-click
functionality, without line numbers affecting the result.

## Standard Props (standard-props)
