# Versioning

lexour follows <ExLink href={semver}>semantic versioning (semver)</ExLink> &#32;
principles.

Given a version `a.b.c`:

-   For bug fixes (e.g. incorrect tokenization, theming), a patch is released,
    incrementing `"c"` (`1.2.3 => 1.2.4`).
-   For new features (e.g. a new language, theme, or annotation type), a minor
    version is released, incrementing `"b"` (`1.2.4 => 1.3.0`).
-   For breaking changes, a major version is released, incrementing `"a"`
    (`1.3.1 => 2.0.0`). Major releases may include new features; any release may
    fix bugs.

Breaking changes are inconvenient and will be avoided wherever possible.
